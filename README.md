My Bash and Vim environment.

Vim environment requires a checkout from [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim).

Need to add:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc_as
```

to the end of your `.bashrc`.

The ZSH profile relies on [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). For the theme to look correct you'll need to edit your console font to have extra symbols. It's basically `agnoster` so just follow the documentation for setting that up.
